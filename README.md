# PBT + A2C implementation of SC2 RL bot

The goal of this project to implement a Starcraft II reinforcement learning bot through the SC2LE interface (https://deepmind.com/documents/110/sc2le.pdf) using A2C algorithm published by OpenAI adapted for the SC2 environment, and integrate it with the PBT (population based training) optimalisation algorithm. The results will be evaluated and compared to previous solutions.

The base A2C algorithm implementation was taken from https://github.com/pekaalto/sc2aibot and is being refactored and modified to fit the needs of this project.
